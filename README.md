<h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Dealing with node, npm packages,mysql2, sequelize, express-handlebars, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, connect-session-sequelize. I've made a tech blog that utilizes CRUD methods. This application isnt 100% functional yet due to me getting sick so I plan on finishing this after I get my next one done.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First I formated the file structure using MVC paradigm.</li>
    <li>Then I've downloaded the required NPM packages and required them in files.</li>
    <li>Then i've used sequelize to create and make associations between tables with models.</li>
    <li>Utilizing MVC paradigm ive put all server side routes in controllers folder.</li>
    <li>Also made sure to use a .env file to store secure data and utilized it in the config/connection.js to secure a connection to the server</li>
    <li>Again following MVC pardigm inside the public folder have created all the front end logic/routes/styles.</li>
    <li>Then have used handlebars.js to organize/render the html.</li>
    <li>This has been a fun and challenging project and i'm looking forward to the next! </li>
  </ul>
